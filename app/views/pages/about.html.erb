<hr>
<p class="">
  As a web developer and engineer I have years of experience.
  But before I set out on this path I was a working professional at a large company.

<p>
  I know what software experiences mean to a company, and I know how they impact the bottom line.

  I operate a customer driven development method that puts your requirements first.
